# I don't Like talking about myself but apparently it's good to add these things. 

## 💻 A Little About Me
- **Location**: Australia 🇦🇺  
- **What I’m Into**: Programming and exploiting, touching grass. I love social engineering. I use macOS and fedora (bare metal)
- **Random Shit**: I love a good challenge, enjoy a smoke, and I fucking hate the government. Call me a conspiracy theorist, my pronouns are: Told / You / So

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- **Void Inject**: A Discord bot packed with moderation tools, built to kick, ban, and even troll users in the most "creative" ways.
- **404Phish**: My own phishing simulation tool for educational purposes (wink.)
- **inomet (ARG)**: Alternate reality game, designed to pull players deeper into a web of secret codes and puzzles.

## 🔧 Tech & Tools I Use
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, ruby and I'm (sadly) learning C++.
- **Tools I Use**: Custom tools, BeEF, netcat, byob, namp, SQLMap, SEToolkit, Metasploit, Cloudflare, UTM, and anything else that sparks curiosity.
